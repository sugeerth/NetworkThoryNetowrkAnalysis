### What is this repository for? ###

In order to predict if a particular business will do well in
a city/town, we must uncover the properties of the busi-
ness location and the tastes of the residents. For example, a
not-so-good Indian restaurant in very popular area is more
likely to prosper than a very good restaurant in a relatively
unpopular place. One way to measure the success of a busi-
ness is to nd out the number of positive reviews a business
will get based on the reviews it currently has. While taking
into account the location of the business, we have developed
techniques and visualizations that can be used to derive the
future success factor of a business. We also came up with an
algorithm that lets us detect shy users who were paid by
Yelp to write reviews and by eliminating reviews written by
these users before calculating the success factor for a busi-
ness, we can paint a very accurate picture of the future of a
given business
